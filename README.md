# HackWithInfy

Welcome to my HackWithInfy preparation repository! 🚀  
This repository contains a collection of coding problems, solutions, and notes that I practiced while preparing for the **HackWithInfy coding round**.  
The aim is to strengthen problem-solving skills and get hands-on with core DSA concepts commonly asked in the exxam.
